1. There are four projects : Proj. 1+2 and Proj. 3+4. You start with Proj. 1+2. When you want to switch projects, please post a message on the BBS PL版. Your message should be something like this.

I will make the switch when I see this message. (Normally, I check the PL board once a day.) Please do not switch too often (i.e., make the switch only when you really want to switch).

2. Project due date is 2023-06-18 (Sun.) at midnight.

3. If your Windows 8/10/... fails to run PAL-2022-03-03-1-0.exe, it may be because the JDK/JRE your Windows OS is using is incompatible with the old version of JDK upon which PAL-2022-03-01-1-0.exe was built. Therefore, when your Windows 8/10/... does not execute PAL-2021-03-03-1-0.exe correctly or smoothly, you will need to run PAL-2021-03-03-1-0.jar instead, using java.exe of JDK/JRE 6uX. (For some unknown reason, java.exe of JRE 6uX is better than java.exe of JDK 6uX. So, please use java.exe of JRE 6uX to run PAL-2022-03-01-1-0.jar.) Install an older version of JDK by using the jdk-6u7 that I provided should be a good idea.

4. To run PAL-2022-03-01-1-0.jar using java.exe of JDK/JRE 6uX, you will need to do something similar to what is said in Visual-C之安裝與使用.doc. Please consult what is said in Visual-C之安裝與使用.doc when you try to run  PAL-2022-03-01-1-0.jar using java.exe of JRE 6uX.

5. If you use, e.g., ICEInputStream, to read input in your Java code (when you are testing your Java code on your OWN machine), you will need to provide Java.exe with >>HsiaNB50Lib.jar<<. Otherwise, Java.exe will have problems finding relevant ICExxx classes such as ICEInputStream.
